    "In this assignment, you are asked to analyze a 10% sub-sample of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a survey of household portfolios that is representative of the US population. The survey was administered every 3 years from 1989 to 2022. The appendix in this document contains a description of the variables present in this data set (this is a subset; the original SCF contains many more variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Read the CSV file `SCF_10pct.csv` stored in this repository.\n",
    "    2.  Keep only observations where the household head is aged between 25 and 89. \n",
    "    3.  Create the column `'college'`, which contains an indicator variable that is 1 when the household head has at least some college (column `'educ'` is 3 or 4), and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "    4.  Divide the values in the column `'networth'` by 1,000 so that they are reported in thousands of US dollars.\n",
    "    5.  Report the number of observations in the final sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  In this part, you're asked to analyze how net worth (total gross assets minus total debt) varies across the four education levels (no high school, high school, some college, 4-year college or more):\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Compute the average net worth (in thousands of US dollars) by education (use a loop).\n",
    "    2.  Create a bar chart that plots the average net worth by education.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  In this part, you're asked to analyze how net worth has changed over the last 3 decades:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Compute the average net worth (in thousands of US dollars) by survey year (use a loop).\n",
    "    2.  Create a line plot that shows the evolution of average net worth over the years 1989 to 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Finally, combine the analyses from the previous parts to see how net worth evolved over the years for those with and without college.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Compute the average net worth (in thousands of US dollars) by survey year, separately for non-college (`college=0`) and the college-educated (`college=1`).\n",
    "    2.  Create a line plot that shows the evolution of net worth over the years 1989 to 2022 by college status, i.e., your figure should contain two lines, one for college and one for non-college.\n",
